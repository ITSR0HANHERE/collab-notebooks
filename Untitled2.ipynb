EMF Equation of a Single-Phase TransformerDerivation:The transformer operates on Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction.Let $N_1$ = Primary turns, $N_2$ = Secondary turns.Flux $\\phi = \\phi_m \\sin(\\omega t)$.Induced EMF $e = -N \\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = -N \\frac{d}{dt}(\\phi_m \\sin \\omega t) = -N \\omega \\phi_m \\cos \\omega t$.Maximum EMF $E_m = N \\omega \\phi_m = 2\\pi f N \\phi_m$.RMS value $E_{rms} = \\frac{E_m}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2\\pi f N \\phi_m}{\\sqrt{2}} = 4.44 f N \\phi_m$.Equations:Primary EMF: $E_1 = 4.44 f N_1 \\phi_m$Secondary EMF: $E_2 = 4.44 f N_2 \\phi_m$Equivalent Circuit Parameters:$R_1, X_1$: Primary resistance & leakage reactance.$R_2, X_2$: Secondary resistance & leakage reactance.$R_c, X_m$: Core loss resistance & magnetizing reactance.(Draw a standard transformer equivalent circuit showing input $V_1$ feeding into $R_1, X_1$, then the parallel branch $R_c || X_m$, then the ideal transformer, then $R_2, X_2$ to load $V_2$.)2. DC Shunt and Series MotorDC Shunt Motor:Connection: Field winding ($R_{sh}$) is parallel to the Armature ($R_a$).Equations:$V = E_b + I_a R_a$$I_L = I_a + I_{sh}$Characteristics: Speed is nearly constant (drops slightly with load). Torque is proportional to armature current ($T \\propto I_a$).DC Series Motor:Connection: Field winding ($R_{se}$) is in series with the Armature.Equations:$V = E_b + I_a (R_a + R_{se})$$I_L = I_a = I_{se}$Characteristics: High starting torque ($T \\propto I_a^2$ before saturation). Speed is dangerously high at low loads ($N \\propto 1/I_a$).(Draw standard $N$ vs $I_a$ and $T$ vs $I_a$ curves: Shunt speed is flat, Series speed drops hyperbolically. Shunt torque is linear, Series torque is parabolic.)3. Universal Gates and Full AdderUniversal Gates:NAND and NOR are universal gates because any Boolean logic function (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) can be implemented using only these gates.Full Adder:A combinational circuit that adds three bits: A, B, and Carry-in ($C_{in}$).Outputs: Sum ($S$) and Carry-out ($C_{out}$).Logic Equations:$S = A \\oplus B \\oplus C_{in}$$C_{out} = AB + C_{in}(A \\oplus B)$Logic Diagram: Two XOR gates, two AND gates, and one OR gate (or two Half Adders + OR gate).4.
